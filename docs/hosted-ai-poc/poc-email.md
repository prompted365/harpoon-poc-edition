# Homeskillet + Hosted.AI: 30-Day Proof of Concept

Subject: POC Proposal: Homeskillet Orchestration Platform - GPU Allocation Integration

Hi [Hosted.AI Team],

Following our productive discussion and demo, I'm excited to share our proof of concept architecture for integrating Homeskillet with the Hosted.AI platform. 

## What is Homeskillet?

Homeskillet is a covenant-based AI orchestration system that enables dynamic routing of inference requests across multiple model providers. What makes it unique is our "fusion" approach - we don't just route requests, we intelligently decompose complex tasks into fragments that can be processed by the most suitable models, then recombine the results.

## POC Architecture Overview

Our integration leverages Hosted.AI's software-defined GPU capabilities through three key components:

1. **Dynamic vGPU Allocation** - Request GPU resources on-demand based on model requirements (e.g., 5 TFLOPS + 2GB VRAM for Gemma-2B)

2. **Intelligent Routing** - Our orchestrator analyzes incoming requests and allocates them to appropriate GPU pools, supporting both dedicated and preemptible workloads

3. **Multi-tenant Isolation** - Each inference request gets its own allocation_id, ensuring complete isolation at the GPU core, memory, and user access levels

## Technical Implementation

```
User Request → Homeskillet Orchestrator → HostedAI Connector
                                            ├── Allocate vGPU
                                            ├── Run Inference  
                                            └── Release Resources
```

The system already includes:
- WebSocket MCP for real-time model interactions
- WASM classifier for edge deployment scenarios  
- Comprehensive monitoring and telemetry
- Docker-based deployment with Kubernetes support

## 30-Day POC Deliverables

**Week 1-2: Integration**
- Complete API integration with Hosted.AI endpoints
- Implement authentication and secure credential management
- Add retry logic and circuit breakers

**Week 3: Validation**
- Performance benchmarking across model sizes
- Multi-tenant isolation testing
- Cost optimization analysis

**Week 4: Production Readiness**
- Deploy to staging environment
- Load testing and scaling validation
- Complete integration documentation

## What We Need From You

To begin the POC, we'll need:
- API endpoint URLs and authentication credentials
- GPU pool identifiers for testing
- Rate limits and quota information
- Staging environment access

Our system is designed to complement Hosted.AI's strengths - while you handle the complex GPU virtualization layer, we provide the intelligent orchestration that maximizes utilization and enables novel AI workflows.

Looking forward to collaborating on this POC and demonstrating how our unconventional approach to AI orchestration can showcase the full potential of your GPU virtualization platform.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
