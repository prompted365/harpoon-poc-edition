## 💬 Final 30-Second Pitch (Memorized)

> "Harpoon brings intelligent orchestration to hosted.ai's multi-tenant GPUaaS platform. We have production infrastructure operational—routing across Groq, Workers AI, and OpenAI based on user intent and cost constraints. **We haven't onboarded enterprise customers yet, but our technology is ready.** What makes this powerful for hosted.ai is our **covenant system**: users describe what they want in natural language, and we automatically translate that to optimal GPU pool selection—whether that's your temporal scheduling for security or spatial scheduling for performance. We see hosted.ai as our primary GPU tier, and **we'd love to be your first orchestration partner—co-developing the integration patterns that future partners will follow.**"

---

## 🎤 Key Talking Points (Abbreviated)

### Opening Hook
"Since October, Harpoon evolved from Rust PoC to production-ready TypeScript platform on Cloudflare's edge."

### Technical Credibility
"We chose Rust for zero-copy parallelism—same reasons you chose temporal scheduling for deterministic performance."

### Value Connection
"Your Hyperdrive work virtualized storage. hosted.ai virtualizes GPUs. Harpoon makes that virtualization *intelligent*."

### Partnership Ask
"Be our first GPU partner. Let's define how covenant orchestration works with multi-tenant scheduling before the patterns are established."
